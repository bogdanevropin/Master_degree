Contributed OOMMF modules from third parties
============================================

This OOMMF source code distribution includes in this directory a collection
of contributed OOMMF extension modules from multiple sources.  Each module
is contained in one subdirectory.  The contents of that subdirectory should
correspond to the original module as published by its creators.  There may
also be a .patch file in this directory containing changes to the module
that the OOMMF team has found necessary in order for the module to function
in light of changes to OOMMF.

This collection is meant to be managed with the OOMMF utility program, oxspkg.
Full documentation for oxspkg is in the OOMMF User Guide.  The command to
make a contributed module (e.g. ucsd_gpu) available to be included in the
build of OOMMF is

   tclsh oommf.tcl oxspkg install ucsd_gpu

This will place the appropriate sources, patched as needed, under the
directory oommf/app/oxs/local so that they are included in the next OOMMF
build.

As distributed, OOMMF installs and builds all contributed modules that can
reliably be built using only the same set of dependencies as OOMMF itself.
Any contributed module that requires support libraries or specialized build
tools is not included by default.  End users need to use oxspkg to install
such modules for themselves after they verify they have a suitable build
environment.
